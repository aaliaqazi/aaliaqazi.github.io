 <b> <p> <h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:Nexa;font-style:bold;color:#0C97B3 ;">ABOUT ME </p> </h1>
<p style ="text-align:center;color:#0C97B3 ; font-family:signpainter sc;font-size:20px;font-style:italic"> 
  I am a sophomore at The University of Texas at Austin majoring in Supply Chain Management with a certificate in Business and Public Policy. Growing up in Houston, I lived with my parents, my older brother (and now my sister-in-law), and grandparents. My dad's side lives in Houston, so I hangout with my cousins often as well. My family and friends mean everything to me, and I love spending time with them :) </p>

  My favorite things to do are bingewatching TV shows on Netflix and going out to eat/trying new restaurants. Currently, my favorite place to eat is Main Chick, a hot chicken food truck chain. I've recently started cooking, so it has been fun to try new recipes and discover a new hobby! My favorite cuisines would definitely be Pakistani and Chinese, but my all time favorite foods are pancakes and french fries. I also enjoy traveling to new countries and learning about other people's cultures. I go to Nairobi, Kenya and Karachi, Pakistan the most because that is where my mom's side and dad's side of the family live, respectively. </p>

 <p style="text-align: center;color:#0C97B3; font-family:Nexa;">My favorite website is Netflix because I started watching shows with my mom this past summer, which made me become even closer to her.
